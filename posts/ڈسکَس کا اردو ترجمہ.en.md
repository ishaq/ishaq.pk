This blog uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments and it was bothering me that it was not in [Urdu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu). So I went ahead and [localized](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/disqus/language/ur/) it (some if it already was). However, urdu localization's review hasn't even started yet. I have tried contacting Disqus team about it but no response so far. If you are an active [transifex](https://www.transifex.com) user and know urdu, you can apply to become a reviewer.

[CLE](http://www.cle.org.pk)'s [glossary](http://www.cle.org.pk/software/localization/OSS/ossGlossary.html) is useful for Urdu localization. You can download it [from their website](http://www.cle.org.pk/Downloads/localization/OSS/Localization%20Terminology%20Glossary%20(ur-PK).zip).


**UPDATE 2014-07-17** Burak from Disqus team got back to me that in absence of any other active member, I have been given reviewer rights too. Thanks! I have reviewed the translations. Hopefully these would get integrated in the Disqus system in next couple of days.
