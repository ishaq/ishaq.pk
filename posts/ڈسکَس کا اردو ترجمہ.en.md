This blog uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments and it was bothering me that it was not in [Urdu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu). So I went ahead and [localized](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/disqus/language/ur/) it (some if it already was). However, urdu localization's review hasn't even started yet. I have tried contacting Disqus team about it but no response so far. If you are an active [transifex](https://www.transifex.com) user and know urdu, you can apply to become a reviewer.
