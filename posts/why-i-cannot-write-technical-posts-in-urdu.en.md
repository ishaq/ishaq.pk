[Urdu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu) is our national language and is, therefore, very dear to me. However, you'll find that technical posts on this blog are in English. It is not because these posts cannot be effectively written in Urdu. I am to blame instead.

It is not possible to write a technical post without English phrases. This is specially true for code excerpts and URLs. Unfortunately I don't know how to mix left to right (LTR) text with right to left (RTL) text. Writing the whole post in right to left (RTL) text messes up the formatting of English sections as is evident in [this post](../../posts/authorization-header-missing-for-get-request-server-returns-http-401-unauthorized.html).

I am still searching on how to mix LTR text in an RTL post in Markdown and reStructured Text. Until I do, you'll have to excuse me. It's not a shortcoming of Urdu, it's mine.
