<html><body><p>When using <a title="Orthello 2D Home" href="http://www.wyrmtale.com/orthello">Orthello2D</a>, always reference images through sprite sheet (<strong>OTSpriteSheet</strong>) or a sprite atlas object. This also applies to situations where you are using one single image. For example, for level background, it seems faster to create an <strong>OTSprite</strong> object behind everything and assign the level background image to the <strong>Image</strong> field of <strong>OTSprite</strong> object. Don't do it. Create a sprite sheet (<strong>OTSpriteSheet</strong>) for the background image (it would have a single frame) and assign this sprite sheet to the <strong>Container</strong> field of <strong>OTSprite</strong>. This is better because it allows you to use multi-resolution artwork. See Multi Resolution Art example in Orthello 2D examples for a demo.


<em><strong>Update (Aug 20, 2013):</strong> The above point is now invalid after the release of Orthello 2.8.2 which has <a title="Orthello 2.8.2 multi-resolution support" href="http://www.wyrmtale.com/blog/2013/148/orthello-2-8-2">changed/improved how multi-resolution art is loaded</a>.</em>

When importing images for a 2D game, set <b>Texture Type</b> to <b>GUI</b>, this would make sure they get imported at correct dimensions even when they are not power of two (NPOT). Keep texture's <strong>Format</strong> to <strong>Compressed</strong>.</p></body></html>
