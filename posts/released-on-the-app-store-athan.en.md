**TLDR;** [App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/athan-weather-forecast-salaat/id898804259?mt=8)

[Athan +](http://azaan.kahaf.com/), or Azan +, has been released to the App Store. It's a simple utility that displays times for prayers and 5 day forecast.

Why yet another Azan app you might ask? We have seen a few Islamic apps but none of them provided weather forecasts. We wanted prayer times and weather forecasts in one app, hence Athan + (or as I like to call it: Azan +).

The app's beautifully designed dashboard provides all the important information in one place. You can set alarms for indvidual prayers with one tap. By default the app uses iPhone's default notification sound to alert for prayers. This is the better setting in our observation because you get to know the prayer time, and if you have to shut the alarm off, you are not disrespecting Athan. You can change this to Athan sound  in the settings. You can also change the look and feel of the dashboard to your liking by picking a theme from several beautifully designed themes.

To implement the application, We used the library written by [Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh](http://praytimes.org/) to calculate prayer times. For weather data, we investigated a few services. It was a trade off between low cost and accuracy. We eventually settled on [World Weather Online](http://worldweatheronline.com/), It provides a accurate enough data while not being unreasonably expensive.

Athan + does one thing and does it good. We are still not satisfied with it though, that is why we are calling this version 0.5.0 instead of 1.0.0. We wanted to release early and then let user feedback steer us. So if there's something you would like us to add, do give us a shout.

Some of the features we are considering for future version are:

1. Multiple Languages (Urdu, Arabic, Dutch and more)
2. Monthly Prayer Timetable
3. Qibla Compass
4. Salaat Text and Salaat Rakaa's
5. Other Important Texts (e.g. Dua-e-Qunoot, Ayat-ul-Kursi, Dua-e-Janaza, Tasbeeh Taraveeh, etc).
6. How to perform Wudhu and Ghusl
7. How to perform salaat (Daily Salaat)
8. How to perform Janaza
9. How to perform Salaat-e-Eid
10. How to say Athan in mosque (being a Moazzan)
11. How to perform Imamat
12. How to perform other Salaats (e.g. Istasqa, Hajaat, etc)
13. How to say Athan to a new born
14. How to perform Nikah

The list is in no particular order, but the features do seem to get less important as you go down. These are the things we come across in our daily lives, some are what one might ask others e.g. Qibla direction, others are what one might get asked e.g. to be Imam.

Athan + is a small, simple app. If you want weather forecast and prayer times on one screen, [do try it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/athan-weather-forecast-salaat/id898804259?mt=8).
